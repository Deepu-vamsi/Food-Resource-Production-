        <!-- Challenge 1: Climate Change -->
        <h2>1. Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change poses a significant challenge to food production systems worldwide. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events can disrupt agricultural practices, leading to reduced crop yields. Farmers must adapt to these changes, often requiring new techniques, crop varieties, and investments in technology to sustain production levels.</p>

        <!-- Challenge 2: Resource Depletion -->
        <h2>2. Resource Depletion</h2>
        <p>The overexploitation of natural resources, such as water, soil, and biodiversity, poses a serious threat to sustainable food production. Excessive water use for irrigation, soil degradation from intensive farming practices, and loss of biodiversity from monoculture practices can lead to long-term damage to the environment. Addressing resource depletion requires innovative practices that balance productivity with conservation efforts.</p>

        <!-- Challenge 3: Economic Barriers -->
        <h2>3. Economic Barriers</h2>
        <p>Many farmers face economic challenges that hinder their ability to adopt sustainable practices. The initial costs of transitioning to organic farming, hydroponics, or other innovative methods can be high, and financial support or incentives may be lacking. Additionally, market access and pricing disparities can make it difficult for sustainable farmers to compete with conventional farming operations.</p>

        <!-- Challenge 4: Knowledge and Technology Gaps -->
        <h2>4. Knowledge and Technology Gaps</h2>
        <p>The lack of access to information, training, and technology can hinder the adoption of sustainable farming methods. Many farmers, especially in developing regions, may not be aware of the latest agricultural innovations or sustainable practices. Bridging these knowledge gaps through education and outreach programs is essential for promoting effective and sustainable food resource production.</p>
